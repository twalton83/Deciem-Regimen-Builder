# Deciem (The Ordinary) Regiment Builder

As a fan of The Ordinary skincare, I found it frustrating that despite many products are unable to be used together, it was difficult to find this information! I decided to build this regiment builder so one can easily see which products are able to be used in their skincare regiment as they add products to their cart. This project also mirrors an ecommerce experience, with a live shopping cart and checkout (which of course, isn't functional!)

NOTE: I am in no way, shape, or form associated with Deciem, or any of the Deciem brands and claim no ownership of the assets used in this project.
